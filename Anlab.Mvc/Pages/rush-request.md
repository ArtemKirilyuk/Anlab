title: "Rush Request Policy"

---
<p>The UC Davis Analytical Lab strives to meet its clients’ turnaround time requirements. The Lab’s turnaround time goal is to report testing results within four weeks from sample submission. In fairness to all submitters, samples are processed in the order received by the Lab. Therefore, it is in everyone’s best interest that samples be submitted as soon as possible following collection.</p>
<p>If your analytical results require an expedited time frame, please contact the Laboratory Director, Dirk Holstege, prior to sample submission to ensure that your request can be accommodated.</p>
<p>Rush requests are reviewed and approved based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the laboratory’s resources and workload at the time of the request</li>
<li>diagnostic need (e.g., time-sensitive field management decisions are needed)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Charges for Rushes:</p>
<ul>
<li>requests to rush samples in less than the established four week turnaround time are subject to additional charges totaling 50% of the original listed price</li>
<li>samples submitted for diagnostic needs will not incur additional charges</li>
</ul>
